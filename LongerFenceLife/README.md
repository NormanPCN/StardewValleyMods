## Description

### Fence Life
Sets a multiplier for the default game fence life. 1.0 gives the vanilla fence life.
You can set the life anywhere from 0.5 to 5.0.
This mod detects when you drop/place a fence from your inventory. At that time it changes the health to the modified value.
After this point, all game functions wiuth respect to life/health function normally as in the vanilla game. The mod is hands off in this regard.
Wood Fence Life: Defualt = 2.0 (approx 1 year)
Stone Fence Life: Default = 2.0 (approx 2 years)
Iron Fence Life: Default = 1.3 (approx 3 years)
Hardwood Fence Life: Default = 1.0 (approx 5 years)
Gate Life: Default = 1.0 (approx 4 years)
