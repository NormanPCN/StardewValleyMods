 config.json is a simple text file and easy to edit. It might be hard to find the Mods folder for some.

Combat Controls Redux also supports the Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM) interface.
GMCM is a much easier way to configure Combat Controls Redux.
GMCM provides a graphical user interface to configure the Mod settings.

The NexusMods page shows the locations of the GMCM config button(s).

## Description

This Mod is intended to be used with a mouse. That is it's reason for existence.  
This Mod does support button remapping and thus other controller types. Control from other than a mouse has not been tested.

### Fixed Mouseclick character facing direction  
Config setting = MouseFix. Default = true.  
Turns the character in the direction of your mouse click. This functions with Swords, Clubs, Daggers and Scythe.
Tools like the pickaxe operate as normally in the game.
The game's normal functions for turning a character with mouse clicks check what specific tile is clicked,
requiring that the exact tile next to the character is clicked in order to turn the character towards it.
This mod makes it so that clicking in the general direction of a tile is enough to turn the character.

### Auto Swing  
Config setting = AutoSwing. Default = false.  
Holding the Use Tool button down will continuously swing the weapon. For swords and clubs.

### Auto Swing Dagger  
Config setting = AutoSwingDagger. Default = true.  
Holding the Use Tool button down will continuously attack with a dagger. Daggers attack very fast and auto swing can be very effective.

### Slick Moves!  
Config setting = SlickMoves. Default = true.  
Slick Moves does not function unless Mouse Fix is also enabled (true).
When running and attacking to the sides, the character will slide along the ground while swinging the weapon.
For swords and clubs.


> ### Sword Secondary Attack Dash  
> Config setting = SwordSpecialSlickMove. Default = true.  
> A quick dash while using the secondary attack. Use by hitting the use tool (attack) button immediately after the secondary attack and moving in the direction you want to dash.
> Enabled for swords.

> ### Club Special Slick Move  
> Config setting = ClubSpecialSlickMove. Default = false.  
> This allows the club special attack to do the sliding slick move. Use by hitting the use tool (attack) button immediately after the secondary attack.
> One may not want the club special area attack to move the player during the attack. This can help you keep your distance from enemies.
